## Installation

- Use the requirements.txt to download the required packages (pip install -r requirements.txt
- It is configured to only pull 'Recent' and '2019' JSON feeds, use python cve.py -i to download these feeds. To get more JSON feeds, add URLs under the section that starts with "if sys.argv[1] == '-i'"
- Please modify the versions listed in the script to match your environment. The ASA versions are all over the place in the CVE feeds, with some being 9.6.4 and others being 9.6(4). When in doubt, use both!
